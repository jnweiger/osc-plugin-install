allow installation of subpackages. e.g. dvswitch-git-client

all needed repostiories are always added as tmp1,tmp2,.. even if they are
already in zypper's list. This causes excessive refreshes!

Calling sudo from subprocess.Popen() almost always reprompts for the password.
  What is the reason? new pty??

New feature: background task while installing:
 - download the specfile and check for source tar balls with newer date or higher version numbers.
 - print a warning after installation if it appears outdated. Naming potential urls for newer source.
 - print a congratulations message if this is the latest version.

osc sup aka source-update different file: osc-source-update.py
 - do the above on a checkout.

Implement osc meta prj parsing, if ymp is not available

Remove all -p from zypper calls, if adding repos permanently.
